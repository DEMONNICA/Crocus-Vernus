> [5.5.0]
>
> - Added `module_remove_check()` to `customize.sh` — replaces inline deletion logic with a proper named function.
> - Added full `detect_root_all()` to `customize.sh` — replaces simple 3-line root detection with comprehensive multi-variant detection for KernelSU, Magisk, and APatch including spoofed variants, writes `.method` file on detection.
> - Added `VortexSU` to `detect_root_all()` in `customize.sh` and spoofed fallback handling in `service.sh`.
> - Added `Kokoro Mask` to Magisk variant detection in `customize.sh`.
> - Added `aapt`-based spoofed variant fallback to `detect_root_all()` in `customize.sh`, checked before the generic `ksud` output fallback.

> - Added `set_donate_link()` to `customize.sh` — inserts timezone-aware donate link (PayPal or Sociabuzz) into `module.prop` after banner line.
> - Added `wait_boot()` to `cv` — waits for `sys.boot_completed=1` before running any optimization.
> - Added `backup_val()` to `cv` — saves original sysctl value to `$MODDIR/backup` before overwriting, skips if backup already exists.

> - Changed shebang in `cv` from `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/system/bin/sh`.
> - Changed `optimize_zram` in `cv` — added `/proc/swaps` check before reset to prevent race condition.
> - Changed `sleep` delay in `cv` `main()` — reduced from 2 to 1 second between functions.
> - Changed `tune_governor()` call in `cv` `main()` — now called twice with `sleep 3` between calls to handle governor reset by system after boot.

> - Changed `set_permissions()` in `customize.sh` — added `service.sh` to the executable permission loop.
> - Changed `post_install_actions` in `customize.sh` — wrapped into a proper named function.

> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — added sysctl restore loop that reads from `$MODDIR/backup` and writes back original values before cleanup.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — added `.method` file deletion for KernelSU, Magisk, and APatch directories.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — replaced extension-based file deletion in `/data/user_de` and `/data` with system cache directory cleanup covering `/data/cache`, `/data/dalvik-cache`, `/data/resource-cache`, `/data/system/dropbox`, and `/data/tombstones`.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — added `fstrim` across all major partitions on uninstall.

> - Changed `MODDIR` detection in `uninstall.sh` — replaced `cd/dirname/pwd` with `readlink -f`.
> - Changed `detect_root_all()` structure in `customize.sh` — replaced `if/elif` chains with loop-based detection using `pkg:label` entries.
> - Changed root detection order in `customize.sh` and `service.sh` — now APatch → KernelSU → Magisk (previously KernelSU → Magisk → APatch).
> - Changed APatch `.method` file format in `customize.sh` and `service.sh` — expanded from 4 to 5 lines, adds `APATCH_APP_VER` on line 3.
> - Changed `APATCH_VER_CODE` source in `customize.sh` — now read from `/data/adb/ap/version`, falls back to `.method` line 5 if unavailable.
> - Changed `service.sh` — root detection now reads from `.method` file instead of inline detection.
> - Changed `MODDIR` detection in `service.sh` — replaced `cd/dirname/pwd` with `dirname/readlink -f`.
> - Changed description format in `service.sh` — removed emoji and Android version, now outputs `✅ ${ROOT_METHOD} (${ROOT_VERSION}) | Improve the speed and smoothness...`.
> - Changed license from GNU General Public License to Apache License 2.0.
> - Removed `hjggum.uaqona.iogbgn` package check from KernelSU Next detection in `customize.sh`.
> - Removed inline root detection from `service.sh` — replaced by `.method` file reading.
> - Removed `ANDROID_VERSION`, `ANDROID_SDK`, and emoji `case` block from `service.sh`.
> - Removed `[FINAL]` tag injection from `service.sh`.
> - Removed `Kernel Tweak` name injection from `service.sh`.
> - Removed `/storage/emulated/0` junk file cleanup from `uninstall.sh` — avoids unintended deletion of user storage.
> - Removed `SKIPUNZIP=1` and `DEBUG=false` from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `MODPATH` and `TMPDIR` fallback lines from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `print_time()` and `print_device()` standalone functions from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `detect_snapdragon()` function and Snapdragon-only abort from `customize.sh` — module now supports all SoC.
> - Removed `SOC` variable and `ARCH` echo from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `check_device()` from `cv` — no longer needed after Snapdragon restriction lifted.
> - Removed `SDK` variable from `cv` — unused after `check_device()` removal.
> - Removed `wait_boot()` from `cv` — redundant since `service.sh` already waits for `sys.boot_completed=1` before executing `cv`.
> - Removed second `tune_governor()` call from `cv` `main()`.
> - Removed `/data/local/tmp` from `cleanup_temp` in `cv` — avoids deleting files in use by ADB or tools.
