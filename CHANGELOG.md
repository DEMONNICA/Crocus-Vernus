> [5.5.0]
>
> - Added `module_remove_check()` to `customize.sh` — removes old module before installation.
> - Added full `detect_root_all()` to `customize.sh` — replaces simple 3-line root detection with comprehensive multi-variant detection for KernelSU, Magisk, and APatch including spoofed variants, writes `.method` file on detection.
> - Added `VortexSU` to `detect_root_all()` in `customize.sh` — detected via `com.vortexsu.vortexsu`, spoofed variant handled in `ksud` fallback.
> - Added `Kokoro Mask` to Magisk variant detection in `customize.sh`.
> - Added `aapt`-based spoofed variant fallback to `detect_root_all()` in `customize.sh`, checked before the generic `ksud` fallback.
> - Added `device_info()` to `customize.sh` — merges `print_time()` and `print_device()` into a single function covering time, module version, device, RAM, Android codename, and kernel info.
> - Added `set_donate_link()` to `customize.sh` — inserts timezone-aware donate link (PayPal or Sociabuzz) into `module.prop` after banner line.
> - Added `backup_val()` to `cv` — saves original sysctl value to `$MODDIR/backup` before overwriting, skips if backup already exists.
> - Added `tune_kernel()` to `cv` — extracts kernel parameter tuning into a dedicated function.
> - Added `tune_vm()` to `cv` — extracts VM parameter tuning into a dedicated function.
> - Added `tune_net()` to `cv` — extracts network parameter tuning into a dedicated function.
> - Added `cleanup_temp()` to `cv` — extracts temporary file cleanup into a dedicated function.
> - Added full root detection from `.method` file to `service.sh` — reads KernelSU, Magisk, and APatch method and version on boot.
> - Changed `cv()` in `cv` — integrated `backup_val()`, removed `chown root:root`, `chmod 644`, and `chmod 444`, now writes directly with `echo` and `2>/dev/null || true`.
> - Changed shebang in `cv` from `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/system/bin/sh`.
> - Changed `optimize_zram` in `cv` — added `/proc/swaps` check before reset to prevent race condition.
> - Changed `detect_root_all()` structure in `customize.sh` — replaced `if/elif` chains with loop-based detection using `pkg:label` entries.
> - Changed root detection order — now APatch → KernelSU → Magisk in both files (previously KernelSU → APatch → Magisk in `customize.sh`, KernelSU → Magisk → APatch in `service.sh`).
> - Changed APatch `.method` file format in `customize.sh` and `service.sh` — expanded from 4 to 5 lines, adds `APATCH_APP_VER` on line 3.
> - Changed `APATCH_VER_CODE` source in `customize.sh` — now read from `/data/adb/ap/version` via `su`.
> - Added `APATCH_KERNEL_VER_CODE` fetch in `customize.sh` — queries the latest KernelPatch release tag from GitHub API, falls back to `.method` line 5 if the request fails.
> - Changed `set_permissions()` in `customize.sh` — added `service.sh` to the executable permission loop.
> - Changed `post_install_actions` in `customize.sh` — wrapped into a proper named function.
> - Changed devil messages in `customize.sh` — expanded from 11 to 15 names, removed per-name descriptions.
> - Changed Android codename list in `customize.sh` — added SDK 32 (Snow Cone SL) and SDK 37 (Cinnamon Bun).
> - Changed `verify_module()` verified message in `customize.sh` — removed emoji, now outputs `Verified Success`.
> - Changed `service.sh` — root detection now reads from `.method` file instead of inline detection.
> - Changed `MODDIR` detection in `service.sh` — replaced `cd/dirname/pwd` with `dirname/readlink -f`.
> - Changed description format in `service.sh` — removed emoji and Android version, now outputs `✅ ${ROOT_METHOD} (${ROOT_VERSION}) | Improve the speed and smoothness...`.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — restore logic now reads from `$MODDIR/backup` and writes back original values before cleanup, with ZRAM handled separately.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — ZRAM restore handles `swapoff`, `reset`, `disksize`, `comp_algorithm`, and `max_comp_streams` in correct order.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — replaced extension-based file deletion in `/data/user_de` and `/data` with system cache directory cleanup.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — added `fstrim` across all major partitions on uninstall.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` — added `exit 0` at end of script.
> - Changed `MODDIR` detection in `uninstall.sh` — replaced `cd/dirname/pwd` with `readlink -f`.
> - Changed license from GNU General Public License to Apache License 2.0.
> - Fixed `MODDIR` in `cv` — now accepts `MODDIR` as an argument (passed by `service.sh`), falling back to the original `cd/dirname/pwd` detection only when run without an argument. The old `$0`-only detection resolved to `/system/bin` when `cv` was invoked as an encrypted Go binary (Module & Plugin Encryption option) that executes the decrypted script via `sh -s --` on stdin, which reassigns `$0` to the shell path — causing `backup_val()` to fail writing backups outside the module directory.
> - Removed `SKIPUNZIP=1` and `DEBUG=false` from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `MODPATH` and `TMPDIR` fallback lines from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `print_time()` and `print_device()` standalone functions from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `detect_snapdragon()` function and Snapdragon-only abort from `customize.sh` — module now supports all SoC.
> - Removed `SOC` variable and `ARCH` echo from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed inline root detection from `service.sh` — replaced by `.method` file reading.
> - Removed `ANDROID_VERSION`, `ANDROID_SDK`, and emoji `case` block from `service.sh`.
> - Removed `[FINAL]` tag injection from `service.sh`.
> - Removed `Kernel Tweak` name injection from `service.sh`.
> - Removed `/storage/emulated/0` junk file cleanup from `uninstall.sh` — avoids unintended deletion of user storage.
> - Removed `check_device()` from `cv` — no longer needed after Snapdragon restriction lifted.
> - Removed `SDK` variable from `cv` — unused after `check_device()` removal.
> - Removed `/data/local/tmp` from `cleanup_temp` in `cv` — avoids deleting files in use by ADB or tools.
> - Added `verify_module_id()` to `verify.sh` — validates module `id`/`name` against the ZIP's `module.prop` before extraction, aborts on mismatch to deter repacking.
> - Changed hash lookup in `verify.sh` — expanded from sha512/sha256-only to checking md5, sha512, sha384, sha256, sha224, sha1 in priority order.
